title: Womble photography website.

This website is something that is an ungoing project that I am working on for my wifes business.
Of course with zenfolio a lot of the work gets done for you but there is a lot that you have to know on the back end of web development to 
get exactly what you want out of a website.

Here is the link to my wifes photography website [Womble Photo](http://womblephoto.com/)<< for school grade, were having trouble with SSL certificate so link may not work.
or even embed images with the following Markdown:
